Advanced Face Recognition Attendance System

The Advanced Face Recognition Attendance System is a Python-based application designed to automate attendance tracking using facial recognition technology. The system captures and verifies the faces of registered individuals, allowing organizations, schools, and workplaces to track attendance more efficiently and accurately. By eliminating the need for manual logging, this system offers a faster, more reliable, and secure method of tracking attendance.


## Features

-Real-Time Face Detection: Uses state-of-the-art face recognition algorithms to identify individuals in real-time.

-Attendance Logging: Automatically logs attendance when a recognized face is detected, marking the individual as present.

-Database Integration: Stores attendance records in a database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL) for future reference and analysis.

-User Registration: Simple user interface to register new faces for attendance.

-Real-time Alerts: Sends notifications/alerts when attendance is marked successfully or if an unrecognized face is detected.

-Detailed Reports: Generate and export attendance reports (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) in CSV format.

-Scalability: Can be scaled to support multiple users and integrated with other systems such as student management or employee management systems.

-Secure: Face recognition ensures that only registered individuals can mark attendance, preventing proxy attendance.

## Technology used

Python: Core programming language for the system.

OpenCV: Library for real-time computer vision tasks, including face detection and recognition.

dlib: Facial landmark detection and facial recognition library.

face_recognition: A Python library built on top of dlib for easy face recognition.

SQLite/MySQL: Database systems for storing user and attendance data.

NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulations.

Tkinter: GUI for user registration and attendance management (optional).

Pandas

## Roadmap

-User Registration:

The first step is registering a user by capturing their facial image. The system saves the face data (features) in a database for future recognition.

A user can be added by clicking a "Register" button and then capturing their image via a webcam.

-Attendance Marking:

Once a user is registered, the system continuously monitors the webcam for faces.

When a face is detected, it is compared with the database of registered faces.

If a match is found, the system logs the time and marks the individual as present.

-Attendance Report:

At any time, users can generate attendance reports in CSV format, detailing which users were marked present, the date, and the time of attendance.

-Alert System:

The system sends real-time notifications if an unregistered face is detected or if attendance is successfully recorded.


## Installation

1. Prerequisites:
Python 3.6 or higher

A webcam for face detection

A MySQL/SQLite database for storing attendance records

2. Installation:
 1.Clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-face-recognition-attendance.git
```
 2.Install required libraries

3. Configure Database:
Set up a SQLite or MySQL database for storing user and attendance records.

Follow the instructions in the database_config.py file to configure your database connection.

4. Run the Application.

5. Register Users.

    
## Usage

-Register New User:

Capture and store faces for new users via webcam using the "Register" option.

-Mark Attendance:

Once a registered user enters the webcam's view, their face will be detected and attendance will be automatically marked.

-Generate Reports:

Use the "Generate Report" option to create CSV files for attendance logs.

-Notifications:

Real-time notifications will alert you to successful attendance logging or unrecognized faces.
